# Netra-AI: Bridging the Diagnostic Gap

**Netra-AI** is a deep-learning-powered diagnostic tool designed to detect **Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)** with specialist-level accuracy. 

## Performance Benchmarks
| Model | Kappa Score | Agreement Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| VGG16 | 0.68 | Substantial |
| ResNet50 | 0.74 | Substantial |
| **Netra-AI (B3)** | **0.8985** | **Near-Perfect** |

## Technical Architecture
1. **Ben Graham’s Preprocessing:** Normalizes lighting and enhances contrast.
2. **EfficientNet-B3:** Balanced depth/width for fine-grained lesion detection.
3. **Grad-CAM:** Visual heatmaps for clinical explainability.
